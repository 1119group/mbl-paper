\section{Introduction}

The interplay of the random disorder and many-body interaction has attracted a
lot of recent research activities\cite{basko2006, oganesyan2007, pal2010,
znidaric2008, huse2013, nandkishore2015, altman2015, huse2014, nandkishore2014,
pekker_hilbert2014}.
The many-body localized (MBL) quantum state\cite{nandkishore2015, altman2015,
huse2014, nandkishore2014, pekker_hilbert2014} of matter is distinctly different
from either the Anderson localization in non-interacting systems or ergodic
state for interacting systems with weaker disorder.
An ergodic state follows the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), which
describes how an isolated self-interacting quantum system can thermalize under
its own internal dynamics in agreement with quantum statistical
mechanics\cite{deutsch1991, srednicki1994, rigol2008}.
An MBL state on the other hand fails to thermalize even for its highly excited
eigenstates on any time scale, resulting in new statistics for such
systems\cite{basko2006, oganesyan2007, pal2010, znidaric2008, huse2013,
  nandkishore2015, altman2015, huse2014, nandkishore2014, pekker_hilbert2014}.
Many remarkable properties of an MBL phase has been
established\cite{nandkishore2015, altman2015, huse2013, nandkishore2014,
  oganesyan2007, pal2010, znidaric2008, rigol2008, serbyn2014, kwasigroch2014,
  yao2014, vasseur2015, huse2014, serbyn2013, ros2015, chandran2014, grover2014,
  agarwal2015, knap2015, luitz2015, devakul2015, torres2015, canovi2011,
  cuevas2012, bauer2013, kjall2014, luca2013, iyer2013, pekker_hilbert2014,
  johri2014, bardarson2012, andraschko2014, laumann2014, hickey2014,
nanduri2014, barlev2014, imbrie2014, groverf2014, ponte2015, huang2015, you2015,
serbyn2015, singh2015, barlev2015, deng2015, chen2015} based on extensive
theoretical studies.
The existence of the ergodic (thermal) phase and MBL phase suggests a dynamic
quantum phase transition between them\cite{basko2006, pal2010, oganesyan2007,
kjall2014, vosk_theory2014, potter2015trans, serbyn2015, agarwal2015, knap2015,
lim2016, zhang2016, zhang2016a, yu2016, vedika2016, dumitrescu2017}.
Random disorder introduces rare Griffiths regions
%\cite{vosk_theory2014, potter2015trans, knap2015,luitz2015,lim2016} which may
%have singular
contributions in driving such a phase transition, but there is still limited
quantitative understanding about their effects. %%\cite{vedika2017}.
Most of Numerical studies of the MBL transition have focused on random disorder
models for spin chains\cite{pal2010, kjall2014, luitz2015, yu2016, vedika2016},
while very recently the dynamic quantum phase transition has been analyzed with
a close comparison between the quasi-periodic and random disorder models, which
point to the possibility of two universality classes for the quantum phase
transition\cite{vedika2017, vedika2016}.

The time evolution of the many-body states have been studied for spin chain
systems with a randomly distributed field\cite{kjall2014,luitz2016time}, which
can be used to address the dynamics of the thermal phase to MBL phase
transition\cite{nandkishore2015,vosk_theory2014,potter2015}.
After a global quantum quench, in the thermal phase, the entanglement entropy is
observed to grow under the power law whereas in the MBL phase, it grows
logarithmically, indicating local memory of the initial product state is
retained for an extremely long time.

In our paper, we discuss findings of our studies of eigenstates and
time-dependent behaviors of this quasi-periodic spin chain system.
Based on the entanglement entropy of eigenstates and the adjacent gap ratio of
eigen-energies, we find the quantum phase transition point of our system to be
similar to albeit lower than that of spin chains with random potentials,
transitioning at $W_c \sim 2$, indicating quasi-periodic systems are more
efficient at localizing.
We also performed time-evolution of randomly selected product states and studied
their entanglement entropy, imbalance and spin glass order.
Similar to the random field model, we find both power-law and logarithmic growth
of the entanglement entropy and that these two regimes are demarcated by
$W_c$, the boundary between the ergodic and MBL phases.
In addition to the general growth trends, we also notice pseudo-periodic
oscillations in our entropy plots for small $t$'s.
The imbalance and spin glass order also display markedly different behaviors in
the two different phases under time evolution, albeit in a different manner from
that of entanglement entropy.
In the thermal phase, both imbalance and spin glass order decay to a saturation
level rather rapidly; in the MBL phase, on the other hand, both imbalance and
spin glass order hover around their respective initial values for extremely long
times, indicating the system is frozen in place and does not follow descriptions
of quantum statistical mechanics.
These results show that quasi-periodic spin chains show qualitatively similar
behaviors with random spin chains with these standard observables.

\section{Model and identify the ergodic to many-body localized phase transition}

We study the Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with the following Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation*}
  H = J\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \mathbf{S}_i \cdot \mathbf{S}_{i+1}
  + \sum_{i}^{N} W\cos(2\pi c i+\phi) S_i^z \text{.}
\end{equation*}
In this Hamiltonian, $\mathbf{S}_i$ is the total spin operator for site $i$ and
$J$ is the nearest neighbor coupling constant.
For the second term of the Hamiltonian which describes the coupling between the
$z$-directional field and our sites, $W$ is the scaling factor of the field
strength and $\phi$ is the phase factor of the cosine function that governs the
field.
Both parameters are adjusted as we study their effects on the behavior of the
system.
The remaining parameter, $c$, is an irrational number which, for the course of
our study, is fixed at $\sqrt{2} - 1$.

This model is similar to the one studied recently in Ref.\cite{vedika2016}.
In this paper, however, we will place our focus on the time-evolution of the
states, which have not been thoroughly studied for systems with quasi-periodic
potentials.
For all our calculations, we used open-boundary condition since it allows a
larger window for observing the time evolution of physical
quantities\cite{luitz2016time} before they saturate due to finite-size effects.
All the results are obtained with highly excited states with energies near the
center of the spectrum.

  \caption{(Color online) (a) For system sizes $L = 10-16$, we notice a crossing
    of $W$ at approximately $1.6$, indicating a quantum phase change. As we can
    see, the dispersion of $\langle Sz \rangle$ decays as $W$ increases and
    tends to zero at larger values of $W$. We conclude that this corroborates
    our conclusion from the entropy plot that the many-body system freezes and
    fails to thermalize with increasing disorder strength.  (b) For system sizes
    $L = 10-16$, we notice the bipartite entanglement entropy of the many-body
    system decays as $W$ increases. We conclude from our plot that the entropy
    of a system described by our model tends to zero at high disorder strength.
    We also notice that our graphs cross at around $W_c=1.6$, indicating a
    quantum phase transition at that point.

We  perform Lanczos exact diagonalization (ED) calculations   to obtain  energy
eigenstates around  the energy $E$ at a target  energy  density $\varepsilon$
for  systems with different  number of sites $L=10-16$  in the total $S_z=0$
sector.  Specifically, for each disorder configuration, we first calculate the
ground state energy  $E_0$ and the maximum energy $E_\text{max}$, which are
used to define the target energy density $\varepsilon = (E-E_0)/(E_\text{max}
-E_0)$.
%Physical quantities\cite{luitz2015}  including the bipartite entanglement
%entropy,  energy level statistics and bipartite  fluctuation of the subsystem
%magnetization are obtained and averaged over disorder configurations and
%sometimes also averaged over  30 energy eigenstates with energies closest to
%the given energy density $\varepsilon$ as detailed below.
We first determine the localization of the MBL transition based on the
entanglement entropy and the fluctuations of the half-system
magnetization\cite{luitz2015}.  The Von Neumann entanglement entropy of the
system  $S$ is obtained  from all eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix
$\rho_A$ as $S=- \tr \rho_A \ln \rho_A$, by partitioning the system in  the
middle.  The entropy is averaged over 30 ($L=12$) to 200 ($L=16$) eigen states
near energy density $\varepsilon=0.5$ in the middle of all eigenstates,   and
$1000$ disorder configurations by choosing random $\phi$ between $(0, 2\pi)$.
As shown in  Fig. 1(a), we plot the  ratio of  entanglement entropy over the
number of system sites  $S/L$ for  different systems  from $L=10$ to $16$  at
the energy density $\varepsilon =0.5$ as a function of random field strength
$W$.  On the  small $W$ side, we have seen an increase of the $S/L$ with $L$,
which saturatue to the Page value ($S/L \sim 0.5\ln(2)$ for large $L$ limit)
following the volume law of the ergodic phase.    On the  larger $W$ side,
$S/L$ approaches zero indicating the area law  entanglement and non-ergodic
behavior  where the MBL state is realized.  With varying $W$,  all data points
approximately cross each other around  a critical value  $W_c \sim 1.6$.  We
compare the entanglement entropy behavior with the  bipartite fluctuations $F$
of the subsystem magnetization $S^z_A$~\cite{luitz2015,song2012}, which is
defined as $F=\left\langle S^{z\,2}_A \right\rangle - \left\langle
S^z_A \right\rangle^2$
as shown  in Fig. 1(b).  We see that the $F/N$ increases on the  small  $W$
side, while it becomes vanishing small on the larger $W$ side.  The $F/N$ curves
for different $N$ approximately cross each other around the critical field
strength $W_c=1.6$ in consistent with the behavior of the entanglement entropy.
In fact, we see that there is an approximate proportional relations between $S$
and $F$  for all $W$  region. 




We further use the  level statistics analysis from the random matrix
theory\cite{atas2013,oganesyan2007} to probe the localization-delocalization
characteristics of  energy  eigenstates.
%In the delocalized  regime, the level-spacing  distribution is described by the
%Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) statistics, which represents extended levels
%with level-repulsion  between them because of the overlap of  energy
%eigenstates in real space.  In the localized regime, the level-spacing
%distribution  is determined by Poisson statistics as  wave-functions close in
%energy are exponentially localized with no level repulsion between
%them\cite{mehta1991}.
In the energy spectrum analysis\cite{luitz2015}, we define the adjacent  energy
gap $\delta_n=E_n-E_{n-1}$ as the energy difference between the $n$-th and
$(n-1)$-th eigenstates, then the adjacent gap ratio can be defined as
$r_n=\min(\delta_n, \delta_{n+1})/\max(\delta_n, \delta_{n+1})$.  We  average the
gap ratio $r=\langle r_n\rangle$  over $30-200$  states near the spectrum center at
$\varepsilon=0.5$   and more than 1000 random  potential configurations for each
given disorder  strength $W$.   As shown in Fig. 1(c),   we see that at the
small $W$ side, $r$ approaches  the Gaussian  orthogonal ensemble  value
(0.5307),  which represents extended levels with level-repulsion  between them
because of the overlap of  energy eigenstates in real space.  On the stronger
$W$ side,  $r$ reaches the Poisson value $(2\ln2-1\simeq 0.3863)$ for larger
systems representing the level statistics of   localized states, where  states
close in energies are  exponentially localized with exponential small overlap
without level repulsion between them\cite{mehta1991}.  A similar level crossing
for all curves is also seen in Fig.1(c),  indicating the same critical point for
the dynamic quantum phase transition.  We also note that,   the critical point
we determined representing an lower  bound for the transition as the crossing
points between larger $L$ curves are moving towards larger $W$ side.    This
feature was also observed in a diferent model for quasi-periodic
systems\cite{vedika2016}.




\subsection{Time-Evolution of quantum state}

We study the quantum dynamics of the quasi-periodic systems after a global
quantum quench.  Here,  we start from a product state
$\ket{\Psi(0)}=\ket{\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots , \sigma_L}$  at the time $t=0$
after the quench, where $\sigma_i=\pm$ represents  the spin-z component $\pm
1/2$ at site $i$.  The state at time $t$ can be obtained as $\ket{\Psi(t)} =
e^{-iHt}\ket{\psi(0)}=e^{-iH\Delta t}\ket{\psi(t-\Delta t)}$ (with setting $\hbar=1$).
We calculate the time evolution of an initial  state  based on  a projection of
the Hamiltonian to the Krylov space spanned by
$\ket{\Psi_0}$, $H\ket{i\Psi_0}$, \ldots, $H^n\ket{\Psi_0}$  using the Lanczos
algorithm by calculating all eigenstates in this space to obtain the
time-evolution operator\cite{luitz2015}.  Using a reasonalble small time step
$\delta t \sim 0.2/J$ allows high accurate results with a small $n=30-60$.


We first discuss the general behavior of the  entanglement entropy as a function
of time as shown in Fig. 2.  On the small $W$ side shown in Fig. 2(a),  we find
that the entropy $S(t)$ grows power-lawly with time $t$ before it reaches the
saturated value $\frac L 2 \ln2$ at long time limit.  On the larger  $W$ side,
we find a much slower growth, which can be fit with a logrithmic growing
function as shown in Fig. 2(b) for $W=3-5$.  


Now we analyze the finite-size scaling behavior of the $S(t)$.  For small $W=1$
as shown in Fig. 3(a),  we find that the initial expansion ($t\sim 1$) of the
$S(t)$ is exponential and system size independent.  For the intermediate time
regime,  the $S(t)$ expands powerlawly until the finite-size effect sets in.
With the increase of $L$,  we find winder time interval for the powerlaw growth
of  the $S(t)$.  Interestingly,  very similar behavior and a smaller window of
the powerlaw growing $S(t)$ are found for $W=2$.  The powerlaw growth indicated
by the straight line in the Fig.3(b) is most clear for larger system size
$N=20$.  This is a strong indication that the $W=2$  is in the thermal phase
consistent with the moving of the crossing point toward larger $W$ with the
increase of $N$ observed in Fig. 1.  We further look into the $S(t)$  at  a
larger $W=3$.  Here we observe that for  small $t$,  $S(t)$ expands
exponentially from the product state to a superposition state for $t\sim 1$,
which then followed by oscillating of $S(t)$.  With further increase of $t$,  we
observe a logrithmic growth of $S(t)$ for time range more than two orders of
magnitude.  The range of $t$ for the logrithmic growing  of $S(t)$ becomes
larger with the increase of $W$.   These results confirm the MBL phase with
similar behavior as the random field case as studied before by Luitz et.
al\cite{luitz2015}. 


Now we address the time evolution of the spin correlations.  As we start from
the product state $|\Psi(0)>$ where the spin-z on each site is  $\pm 1/2$  while
the total $S_z$ of all sites are zero. We define the following time correlators
for spin-z  as $I(t)=\frac 4  L \sum_{j=1}^L
\braket{\Psi(0)|S_j^z(0)S_j^z(t)|\Psi(0)}$, which detects the  total imbalance of
spin-z. As shown in Fig.4(a),  we find a systematic changes of the properties of
the $I(t)$ as $W$ is varied.   For smaller $W=1$,  we see that the long time
behavior of the imbalance $I(t)$ is dominanted by the powerlaw decay
$1/t^{\alpha}$, and at the large $t$ limit  the spin-z on a site becomes
uncorrelated with the initial condition and $I(t)$ approaches zero eventually.
For intermediate $W=1.5$ and $2$,  a similar power-law behavior is obtained with
much smaller decay power $\alpha$, indicating the longer time scale required for
approaching equalibrium spin correlations for these states in the thermal side
close to the transition point to the MBL phase.  At the MBL side with $W=3$ and
$4$,  we see that the $I(t)$ is near constant at large $t$ limit with a near
vanishing decay exponent ($\alpha \sim 0$).

For comparison,  we also study the spin glass order  in the MBL phase.  The
spin-flip  from the Heisenberg term will create the domain walls.  If the
domain walls  are confined together, a spin-glass order can develop.  We define
the spin glass order parameter $ \chi^{SG}=\frac 1 L \sum_{i,j=1}^L
\braket{\Psi(t)|S_i^zS_j^z|\Psi(t)}^2$,  which can diverge with $L$ in the spin-glass
ordered phase.  As shown in Fig.4(b), we see very  similar behavior comparing to
the $I(t)$.  For smaller $W=1-2$,  we see that $\chi(t)$ decreases with $t$ in
powerlaw fasion, while it stays at large value at long time limit for larger
$W>2$.  Our  results indicate a jump of the spin glass order at the thermal to
MBL transition.  In Fig.5,  we see that both $I(t)$ and $\chi(t)$ shows very
weak size dependence at $W=3$.   Clearly, the spin glass order parameter
develops and diverges with system size for the whole time range, which  fully
establishes the robust of the MBL phase.
